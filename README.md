# Coding Quiz Game

## Description

This was my attempt at making a coding quiz game with a set timer and local storage high score.

My motivation for doing this was to improve my skills with JavaScript and understand it's relationship with, not only the DOM, but also with the application as a whole.

I learned a better understanding of JavaScript and functions.

## Installation

As an online web application it requires no installation

## How to use

Pressing the start button should start a timer that counts down while trying to complete the short coding quiz.
